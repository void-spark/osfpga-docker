# osfpga-docker
My open source FPGA tools building docker file

This includes IceStorm, Yosys, nextpnr, Verilator and Icarus Verilog

This is a very basic Docker file which builds a open source FPGA tools Docker image.
I use it by volume mounting my source folder into the container, and then running any commands,
but that's just one option.
